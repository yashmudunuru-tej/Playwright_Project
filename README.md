## 🚀 Project Overview
This project automates the **end-to-end checkout flow** of [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) using **Playwright** with the **Page Object Model (POM)** architecture.  
It demonstrates real-world QA automation practices — from login, sorting validations, and cart management to checkout completion — with integrated HTML reports and GitHub CI runs.
